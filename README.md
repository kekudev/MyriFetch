## 💿 CHDman Usage

### Windows

For safety and security reasons, this repository does not include the chdman.exe executable. Since you cannot always trust third-party binaries and repositories, it is best to download it yourself directly from the official source. This also ensures you get the most recent and compatible version.

1. Go to the [official MAME tools download page](https://www.mamedev.org/release.html), download and install MAME.
2. Go to the CHDman section in settings and select the path to CHDman (where you installed the tools to).
3. Turn on compression per system (PS1, PS2, PSP and Dreamcast).

### Linux

On most distributions, `chdman` is bundled with the `mame-tools` package.

**Method 1: Native Package Manager**

1. Open your terminal.
2. Run the command for your distribution:

**Debian / Ubuntu / Linux Mint:**
```bash
sudo apt install mame-tools
```

**Arch Linux / Manjaro:**
```bash
sudo pacman -S mame-tools
```

**Fedora:**
```bash
sudo dnf install mame-tools
```

**Method 2: Homebrew (Alternative)**

Alternatively, if you use Homebrew on Linux:

1. Open Terminal.
2. Run the following command:
```bash
brew install rom-tools
```

3. Once installed, the program should recognise where the executable is located.

### MacOS

On macOS, `chdman` is available through Homebrew in the `rom-tools` package.

1. Open Terminal.
2. Install Homebrew if you haven't already (https://brew.sh).
3. Run the following command:
```bash
brew install rom-tools
```
